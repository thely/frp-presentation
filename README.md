The CharlottePatDance examples from (Fran)[http://conal.net/fran/tutorial.htm], rewritten in Elm to show both the differences between the two languages and the continuing expressiveness of Elm despite its strict nature.

Has time-based movement, and function composition of elements.

### FibonacciBars
Basic mapping and recursion, plus visuals.

"Sweet rave triangle" was its first description. Rolls with changing window sizes. Mouse position changes the color, rotation, & scale of the triangle, and the position of the octagon.
